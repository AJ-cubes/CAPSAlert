# CAPSAlert

Display icons in the system tray to indicate whether CapsLock is on or off. Display a pulsing circle around the mouse when CapsLock is on and the feature is enabled - code written in AutoHotkey v2.0 (`.ahk`). Code compiled into Windows Executable (`.exe`).

- Icons displayed in the `System Tray`.
- Icons display based on:
  - CapsLock on or off
  - Circle display toggled on or off
- Made with AutoHotkey (`.ahk`)
- Compiled into Windows Executable (`.exe`)

## Installation

There are two methods to install. 

### **Method 1: The AutoHotkey file (`.ahk`)**
- Make sure you have AutoHotkey v2.0 installed on your computer. If not, download [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/v2/).
- Download the AutoHotkey file [here](CAPSAlert.ahk).
- Double-click to run it using AutoHotkey.

### **Method 2: The Windows Executable file (`.exe`)**
- Download the Windows Executable [here](CAPSAlert.exe?raw=true).
- Double-click it to run it. If blocked by Windows Defender, click 'More' then 'Run Anyway'.

### **Show system tray icon**
- In the bottom-right corner of your screen, near the time and Wi-Fi icons, click the up arrow (Ë„).
- Locate the icon for your file or application in the pop-up tray.
- Drag the icon from the pop-up tray into the main area next to the time and Wi-Fi icons.
- Windows will now keep this icon visible in the system tray for easy access.

### **Auto-Start on Boot (Optional)**
To run the script automatically when Windows starts:

1. Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialogue.
2. Type `shell:startup` and press Enter. This opens your Startup folder.
